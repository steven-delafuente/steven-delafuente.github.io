- description: Quantitative spatial-temporal analysis of Fire Department calls for service occurring within the City and County of San Francisco (2016). Visualized incident loads across neighborhoods, time of day, call type, unit type and response time. All analysis completed utilizing R (programing language).

- description: Conducted spatial-temporal cluster analysis of Fire Department calls for service occurring within the City and County of San Francisco (2002-2019). I utilized a dataset consisting of over 5 million records along with block group level census data to investigate the spatial relationship between demographic attributes and emergency incident load. I hope to create a predictive incident model in the future. Python was used for data wrangling, analysis, and charting. ArcMap was utilized for final map products.
